Linux Canon LBP800 CAPT driver
-----------------------

In this package there is a linux driver for Canon LBP800 printer
using CAPT parallel cable protocol.

The general structure of the application is based on Rildo Pragana's 
driver for Samsung ML-85G,see : http://pragana.net - "Adventures in 
Linux Programming", and the LBP810 capt driver from Nicholas Boichat
<nicolas@boichat.ch>.

It should support both A4 and Letter sized paper, but I only tested it
with A4 sized paper.

Install
-------

Type:

# make

Then log in as root and type:

#make install

The driver uses the 'parport_pc' pc-style printer port module that
should be present on molt new linux releases.
The driver don't use direct port access, so root user is NOT necessary.
The driver uses also a complete cups FILTER + BACKEND components, no
need to give a dummy device to driver.

Install in CUPS
---------------

Follow the instructions presented on this page :
http://www.linuxprinting.org/cups-doc.html

When installing, TURN ON THE PRINTER (autodetection tries to enable it).
Select CANON printer, LBP800 driver and one of the detected
'parcapt:/dev/paportn' connection.
If no 'parcapt:/dev/parportn' connection is listed, please chech the
following :
- Is printer ON and CONNECTED ?
- is 'parport_pc' kernel module loaded ? (lsmod | grep parport_pc)

To align the margin, change TopSkip and LeftSkip parameters.
